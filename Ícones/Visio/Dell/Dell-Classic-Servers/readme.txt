The suggested stencil directory for Visio 2003, and 2007 is My Documents\My Shapes\Dell

All stencils work best on pages of scale 1:2 to 1:30 - Template pages with the proper 
settings are available for download on the VisioCafe.  Do not use the Visio "Blank page"
which uses a scale of 1:1 (no scale), it has been found to cause a lot of problems.


VisioCafe provides a place for the public to download free Visio stencils from the technology 
industry. If you would like to host your Visio stencils here for free, please contact us at
